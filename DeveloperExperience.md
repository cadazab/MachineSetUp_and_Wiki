## 1.	The Terminal
You definitely might have a nice, friendly and customizable terminal which contains UNIX/LINUX 
commands. Why is this so important? As a developer you will spend a lot of time doing the following 
tasks:

-	Executing programs
-	Making Git commits, pulls and pushes
-	Viewing the files and logs of your application that are contained normally in a remote server. 
-	Check different sessions, the machine resources that are being used and programing crontab jobs.
-	Setting the available software and libraries in the remote machine, or in the Docker container or Kubernet.
-	Many more…

All of these tasks are performed in the terminal, and if you will work many hours of your daily life in a terminal, 
you rather have something like this:

Than something like this old ugly monster……the windows terminal:

At this point you may ask: can't both terminals do the same things? In theory they can, but the handy shortcuts, 
colors and customizations from UNIX/LINUX terminals really optimize the work. Besides that, aesthetics plays a very 
important role in how we feel, and finally in our performance at work. This is the reason why people prefer to 
work in illuminated, clean and decorated spaces, or to live in cities with architectural intervention and parks, rather 
than in generic concrete soviet blocks. Here you can see an article related to this topic:

And this really interesting video:

Besides the aesthetics, the commands available on the terminal are really important. Nowadays the majority of servers used for development are Linux/Unix based, and it makes sense to use the same commands in the remote machine and in your local computer.
Learning the commands of the windows terminal as well as the commands in Linux is an unnecessary complication.

## 2.	Text editor
In addition to the terminal, we, the developers and programmers, spend the rest of the time writing code. In this respect, it is a matter of taste and there are many good editors available that get the job done, but are some common characteristics that a good text editor should have:

-	Smart auto-completion based on the language that you are using
-	Linter, or live check of syntax errors
-	File system browser
-	Find and replace words across several files
-	Go to class or function definition 
-	Build in package manager to install further features
-	And of course……it has to look Nice!

As I said, it is a matter of taste, and there are several text editors that have all these features, like: SublimeText, Vim, Visual Studio Code, but if you ask me for my favorite, it is Atom:

It has all the mentioned fautures plus, Git and shh integration. 

## 3.	Access
Ok, so you have a nice terminal and a good text editor, let’s write some programs and change the world! But wait, not that fast, frustrations is about to starts and strike our good intentions hard in the face, because access to the machine where the data and files are stored is normally a complicated step. I am not a security or proxy expert, but I was asked to describe my ideal developer experience, and it would be like this: Start my computer and after a somehow authentication process (password, hash or .pem private key, put a fisical key in my computer, whatever) have acces from both, my terminal and my text editor to the remote data, that’s the dream.

##4.	Operating Sytem
All the good text editors are cross-plataform, which means they are compatible with all operating systems, but a good terminal, as I mentioned before, doesn't exist in windows. Even worse, if you want for example, acces a remote machine th
