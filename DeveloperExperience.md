1.	The Terminal
You definitely might have a nice, friendly and customizable terminal which contains UNIX/LINUX 
commands. Why is this so important? As a developer you will spend a lot of time doing the following 
tasks:

-	Executing programs
-	Making Git commits, pulls and pushes
-	Viewing the files and logs of your application that are contained normally in a remote server. 
-	Check different sessions, the machine resources that are being used and programing crontab jobs.
-	Setting the available software and libraries in the remote machine, or in the Docker container or Kubernet.
-	Many more…

All of these tasks are performed in the terminal, and if you will work many hours of your daily life in a terminal, 
you rather have something like this:

Than something like this old ugly monster……the windows terminal:

At this point you may ask: can't both terminals do the same things? In theory they can, but the handy shortcuts, 
colors and customizations from UNIX/LINUX terminals really optimize the work. Besides that, aesthetics plays a very 
important role in how we feel, and finally in our performance at work. This is the reason why people prefer to 
work in illuminated, clean and decorated spaces, or to live in cities with architectural intervention and parks, rather 
than in generic concrete soviet blocks. Here you can see an article related to this topic:

Besides the aesthetics, the commands available on the terminal are really important. Nowadays the majority of servers used for development are Linux/Unix based, and it makes sense to use the same commands in the remote machine and in your local computer. Learning the commands of the windows terminal as well as the commands in Linux is an unnecessary complication.
